Hello my name is Jordan Garcia!

three words to describe me: Random, Creative, Lazy

     My favorite hobby is gaming, and its not even close if i could i would game for 12 hrs a day but unfortunately i 
was not put in the position on were i could do that, and have money to support myself. My love for gaming is really 
crazy some would say an addiction, but if i find anything fun or something im intrested in i could put down the game 
for long periods of time..
